This driver was used to discover a bug in the Apache Commons Imaging 1.0 RC7. The bug report can be found here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMAGING-203
The provided NegSegmentSize.JPEG image triggers the bug. The experiment is described in our CCS'17 paper, found under 'docs' in this repository.

The experiment was inspired by Michal Zalewski's blog "Pulling JPEGs out of thin air": https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-thin-air.html

Steps to run this example:

1. Download Apache Commons Imaging 1.0 RC7
wget https://github.com/apache/commons-imaging/archive/commons-imaging-1.0-RC7.tar.gz

2. Unpack
tar -xzvf commons-imaging-1.0-RC7.tar.gz

3. Build Apache Commons Imaging (tests fail on my system, but it seems no problem to skip them)
cd commons-imaging-commons-imaging-1.0-RC7 
mvn install -DskipTests
cd ..

4. Instrument Apache Commons Imaging (this may take a few minutes)
java -cp ../../instrumentor/build/libs/kelinci.jar edu.cmu.sv.kelinci.instrumentor.Instrumentor -i commons-imaging-commons-imaging-1.0-RC7/target/commons-imaging-1.0.jar -o commons-imaging-1.0-instrumented.jar

5. Compile driver
mkdir bin
javac -cp commons-imaging-1.0-instrumented.jar src/*.java -d bin

6. Instrument driver
java -cp ../../instrumentor/build/libs/kelinci.jar:commons-imaging-1.0-instrumented.jar edu.cmu.sv.kelinci.instrumentor.Instrumentor -i bin -o bin-instrumented

7. Create input directory.
mkdir in_dir

8. Create file in input directory
echo "hello" > in_dir/example

9. Test binary (should print "Done.")
java -cp bin-instrumented:commons-imaging-1.0-instrumented.jar driver.Driver in_dir/example

10. Start Kelinci server
java -cp bin-instrumented:commons-imaging-1.0-instrumented.jar edu.cmu.sv.kelinci.Kelinci driver.Driver @@

11. Test interface (should send file to server, then receive results, then print "Terminating normally.")
../../fuzzerside/interface in_dir/example

12. Run AFL
afl-fuzz -i in_dir -o out_dir ../../fuzzerside/interface @@

Keep an eye on the output directory. In particular, the 'queue' subdirectory will contain input files triggering new behaviors. One may want to have a look at them with e.g. hexdump. After a while, AFL should identify a new path, due to finding the correct first byte of a JPEG header (0xFF). Later, it will identify the second byte of the header (0xD8). At some point it will find the described bug. In our experiment, it took about 35 minutes.
